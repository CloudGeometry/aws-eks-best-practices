## Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) Best Practices

A best practices guide for day 2 operations, including operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization.

This guide is now published to the official [Amazon EKS Docs platform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/best-practices/introduction.html). While this repo continues to be the source, the GitHub.io page will be phased out.

See [latest/bpg](latest/bpg) for the new AsciiDoc formatted files. Contribution guidelines coming soon!
